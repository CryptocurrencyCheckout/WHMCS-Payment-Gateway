**What is CryptocurrencyCheckout:**
CryptocurrencyCheckout is a Cryptocurrency Payment Gateway that allows people to easily start accepting Cryptocurrency on their Online Stores, Websites, and even Donations for their Social Pages, Twitch and Even Youtube Pages all for free.

**No Middleman or Third Party Risk:**
CryptocurrencyCheckout allows direct Peer to Peer decentralized transactions directly from the Customers Wallet to the Stores Wallet with No Middleman ever in control of your cryptocurrency.

CryptocurrencyCheckout allows stores to use any wallet of their choosing, including Desktop wallets, Mobile Wallets, and Cold/Hardware Wallets.

**How it works:**
When an order is submitted via the CryptocurrencyCheckout payment method, the order will be placed "on-hold" inside your WHMCS Admin Dashboard.

The customer will then be passed to the CryptocurrencyCheckout Payment Gateway, the gateway will allow the customer to choose between all accepted cryptocurrencies, manage all real-time Market Calculations, and provide the customer with multiple ways to pay, including 1-Click Wallet Payments, QR Codes for Mobile, or Copy and Paste options for Exchanges/Web Wallets

After the Customer Marks the Payment as sent, the store/seller will verify that the coins have arrived in their wallets, and mark the order as Paid in their WHMCS Admin Dashboard
